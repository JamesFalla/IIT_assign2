								<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p> Using a mobile device such as a phone to scan a serial number of a bike, e-bike, e-scooter and/or mobility scooter to then record and store this item specific information against an individual's personal account in a cloud-based server. This will help to deter would be theft and subsequent sale of stolen items. This registration data can be accessed by a user looking to register a new item or check if an item that is being purchased second hand has been flagged as stolen. The system would also allow one user to transfer item registration to another as proof of a legitimate sale transaction.</p>
								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p>The Level up team have had several bicycles stolen over the years. Each bicycle can be individually identified by a serial number stamped or marked into the frame. Unfortunately, there is no central location to track and store these serial numbers, so the serial numbers are ineffective as a means of tracking the legitimacy of ownership or status. By creating a public registration system that can be easily accessed and utilised with mobile devices, this helps rectify this problem by making the sale of the stolen bicycle more difficult and being able to prove legitimate ownership.
									<br>‘In response to increasing concerns about stolen bikes across Victoria, Bicycle Network undertook a detailed investigation into the common characteristics of bike theft cases.
									<br>We found that:
										<ul>
											<li>The number of bicycle thefts reported in Victoria has increased by 81.2 per cent in the past 10 years</li>
											<li>Only 9 per cent of bike theft cases are solved</li>
											<li>Bike thefts at car parks and multi-dwellings are growing by 40.7 per cent each year</li>
											<li>Only three Victorian local government areas have experienced no year-on-year growth in bike thefts</li>
										</ul>
									<br>The results highlight that bike theft remains a poorly resolved issue across metropolitan and regional Victoria, and may worsen into the future without proper action being taken.’ (Bicycle Network Theft Report 2011-2020, July 2021, page 3).</p>
