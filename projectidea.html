								<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p> Using a mobile device such as a phone to scan a serial number of a bike, e-bike, e-scooter and/or mobility scooter to then record and store this item specific information against an individual's personal account in a cloud-based server. This will help to deter would be theft and subsequent sale of stolen items. This registration data can be accessed by a user looking to register a new item or check if an item that is being purchased second hand has been flagged as stolen. The system would also allow one user to transfer item registration to another as proof of a legitimate sale transaction.</p>
								<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p>The Level up team have had several bicycles stolen over the years. Each bicycle can be individually identified by a serial number stamped or marked into the frame. Unfortunately, there is no central location to track and store these serial numbers, so the serial numbers are ineffective as a means of tracking the legitimacy of ownership or status. By creating a public registration system that can be easily accessed and utilised with mobile devices, this helps rectify this problem by making the sale of the stolen bicycle more difficult and being able to prove legitimate ownership.</p>
									<p>‘In response to increasing concerns about stolen bikes across Victoria, Bicycle Network undertook a detailed investigation into the common characteristics of bike theft cases.
										<br>We found that:
											<ul>
												<li>The number of bicycle thefts reported in Victoria has increased by 81.2 per cent in the past 10 years</li>
												<li>Only 9 per cent of bike theft cases are solved</li>
												<li>Bike thefts at car parks and multi-dwellings are growing by 40.7 per cent each year</li>
												<li>Only three Victorian local government areas have experienced no year-on-year growth in bike thefts</li>
											</ul>
										The results highlight that bike theft remains a poorly resolved issue across metropolitan and regional Victoria, and may worsen into the future without proper action being taken.’ (Bicycle Network Theft Report 2011-2020, July 2021, page 3).</p>
									<h2>Description</h2>
										<p>My Bike Register would be a Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) service for a cloud based mobile application for multiplatform delivery that can be accessed either by mobile device or desk top computer.</p>
										<p>User generated accounts that record the identification and contact details of the account holder. Name, Current Address, Profile Picture, Email Address and Mobile Number Account legitimacy would need to be verified with a mobile number and/or email address. In addition, two factor authorisation (2FA) security will be integrated into each account to ensure secure access by only the account holder.</p>
										<p>Once a user account has been successfully established and verified, bicycles can be added to the account. Bicycles would contain the following information: Serial number, Type, Make, Model, Year of Manufacture, Colour, Place of Purchase, upload a photo of the bicycle, upload proof of purchase receipt and status of the bicycle (for example – Current Owner, For Sale or Stolen).</p>
										<p>The user can store up to one (1) bicycle on the free system. To store more than one (1) bicycle then the user would need to subscribe for five (5) additional storage locations. Mobile device applications would include the optical character recognition feature that could be used to read and then populate the serial number field of the bicycle form. If an owner of a registered bicycle were to sell a bicycle, they would flag the bicycle status flag as “For Sale.” A potential buyer could go to the mobile app and scan or enter the serial number. The buyer would receive the “For Sale” verification notification. As part of the transaction, the bicycle would be transferred to the purchasing users account with all the associated details including the original proof of purchase etc. </p>
										<p>A bicycle that has been stolen can have its status changed to “Stolen.” In this instance there can also be a field made available for the police report reference number with relevant details of where the report was made and to whom. Now when a potential buyer scans or enters the serial number, they will receive a “Stolen” notification. This will simultaneously notify the registered owner of the bicycle's location. The potential buyer will also be presented with a questionnaire regarding the details of the contact with the stolen bicycle and this will be provided to the legitimate owner. Secondary advantages to the user of the register will be the ability to create a report for insurance companies that list the users registered bicycles and provide proof of purchase details. In the event of a claim these details are requested by the insurance company.</p>
										<p>This system can be used for e-bikes and e-scooters as well as mobility scooters. With the values of these items in thousands of dollars, it is a logical step to create this register. This process has truly global potential and is not restricted to the Australian market. Future additions that may be considered is to have a second-hand bicycle sales platform.
